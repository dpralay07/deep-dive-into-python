# SOLID principle is a set of rules that helps in reducing the tight-coupling between the classes.
# The loosely coupled classes minimizes the change of code, and makes the code maintainable, scalable, flexible and stable.
# S - Single-Responsibility Principle
# O - Open-Closed Principle
# L - Liskov-Substitution Principle
# I - Interface-Segregation Principle
# D - Dependency-Inversion Principle
